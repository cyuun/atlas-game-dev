## Game Reviewed: Super Star Wars
Published by Nintendo and LucasArts for the SNES
### 1. Provide a detailed overview of the object of the game.
Super Star Wars is a shooting "run and gun" style platformer where you can run, jump, crouch, and shoot in 8 directions. You encounter a large number of enemies right from the beginning, but you only have to kill the boss at the end of each level in order to advance to the next level. You're given four lives to start the game, and once those run out, you can restart the game from the very beginning, but this can only be done 3 times before the game cartridge itself has to be restarted. The object of the game is just to kill the boss at the end of each level to advance the game
### 2. List 3 or more things that you like about the game. Why?
```
1. The music and the characters were really nice and very reminiscent of the movie.
2. The blaster shots would connect on enemies in a satisfying and easy way despite the lack of direction control
3. Having unlimited ammo makes spamming bullets a fun mechanic, leading to an overall addicting gameplay
```
One of the main design goals for Super Star Wars was just to make a better version of the NES game Star Wars, obviously based on the movie Star Wars. And it certainly succeeded at that goal, which included the aesthetic of replicating the feel of Star Wars. The music and character design were super important in achieving this goal, and did a lot of work to make the game feel more immersive.
### 3. List 3 or more things that you do not like about the game. Why?
```
1. It took me too long to figure out you could shoot in all 8 directions (this is maybe a personal problem)
2. I didn't recognize the enemy design really from the Star Wars movies
3. There were no clear indicators on how to defeat the boss other than just "shoot him to death" which was very hard
```
Having a hard and chaotic game is a dynamic that was implemented to help the game achieve it's goal of feeling like Star Wars. Luke was thrown straight into chaotic and dangerous situations without much proper training at all in the movie, and the game sort of mirrors that. But I found personally that it took me way too many of my limmited lives in the game to figure out what was going on, because death just came so quickly. The lack of indicators made figuring out how to do things a challenge.
### 4. List 3 or more reasons why you think the game you are reviewing is successful.
```
1. Especially with the music and sound design, it plays off of, and fits into, the Star Wars franchise very well
2. The shooting and unlimited ammo are a fun and addicting way to play the game, it draws you in quicly
3. It's a challenging platformer, giving players more of a reason to sink more amounts of time into it
```
With a hard and chaotic dynamic, it makes sense to use the mechanic of letting the player shoot their blaster often and a lot. This helps to balance the difficulty of the game and make it possible to play without being a robot. The music and sound design were crucial in making the game fit into the Star Wars universe, and that certainly helped it's popularity and success as a game when it came out. However, the enemy design I felt was lacking, at least in the first level, and it didn't feel like they helped the game fit into the Star Wars universe at all. To help further meet the design goal of the game, I'd reccomend that the enemies were designed more similarly to what you would find in the Star Wars movies to help remind the player of the franchise more. I'd also reccomend some sort of instruction on how to play the game, as that would help save a new player crucial lives at the beggining. In addition to that instruction, I'd reccomend more clear signals on how to kill the bosses at the end of each level, as in their current state it can sometimes seem like they're just supposed to be shot to death over time which sometimes takes too long and isn't as interesting of gameplay.
