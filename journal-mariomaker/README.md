# Journal: Mario Maker First Level
Peter Rosenthal - ATLS 4140
### Theme:
I chose to go with the Super Mario Bros. 3 style of game because it was actually the Mario that I played the most when I was growing up. I also wanted to use the sunny above ground setting because it felt more recognizable to me than the other settings. I'm not really too sure what I was doing, and so I don't think my level is really too dificult at all, but I don't think it would be too easy as well, so that's nice.
